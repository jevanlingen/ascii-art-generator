# Ascii art generator

This project is created with the goal to learn about the following subjects:
- Google Guice
- Gradle
- Dockerization of Java / Gradle applications

To achieve just that, this is a little project to convert an image to ascii art. As the goal was never to learn anything about generation of ascii, code from the [asciimg](https://github.com/korhner/asciimg) project is copied and simplified in this project.

You can run the app yourself by running following docker command:  
`docker container run --rm -it jacob12345/asciiartgenerator:latest`
